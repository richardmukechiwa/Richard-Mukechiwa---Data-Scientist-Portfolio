## **About Me**

I am Richard Mukechiwa, a passionate data scientist from Zimbabwe with expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and deploying predictive models to solve real-world problems. With a strong foundation in Python, SQL, Power BI, and various machine learning frameworks, I create solutions that offer meaningful business insights. My portfolio showcases my journey through various data science projects that highlight my ability to handle diverse datasets and develop models that drive decision-making.

## **Skills & Expertise**

**Data Analysis:** Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL, Power BI

**Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Tableau, Power BI

**Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost

**Data Engineering:** SQL, ETL, Web Scraping

**Model Deployment:** Streamlit

**Version Control & Collaboration:** Git, GitHub, Jupyter Notebooks

**Cloud: AWS (S3, EC2), Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**

## **Featured Projects**

### [Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/richardmukechiwa/Churn-Prediction-Classification-Model.git)
   
**Goal:** Built a predictive model to identify customers likely to churn, enabling the business to take proactive retention steps.

**Tools:** Python, XGBoost, Scikit-learn, GridSearchCV, Streamlit

##### **Key Highlights:**
- extracted the data from Kaggle
- loaded the in Jupyter notebook  and performed data cleaning
- performed Exploratory Data Analysis
- performed data preprocessing with One hot encoder and Label encoder
- splitted the data into training and testing fractions
- trained  and tested the Logistic Regression algorithm
- model evaluation
- Achieved an overall accuracy score of 80.0% after hyperparameter tuning
- trained and tested the xgboost algorithm
- tuning parameters
- performed feature selection
- deployed on Streamlit for an interactive user interface to explore model predictions.


### [Medical Charges Prediction](https://github.com/richardmukechiwa/Medical_Charges-Prediction-Random-Forest-Regression.git)

**Goal:**  Built a Random Forest Regression model to predict medical charges based on patient demographic data.

**Tools:**  Python, Scikit-learn, Random Forest, Streamlit

##### Key Highlights:
Leveraged feature engineering techniques to improve model accuracy; deployed model for web access.
