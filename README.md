## **About Me**

I am Richard Mukechiwa, a passionate data scientist from Zimbabwe with expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and deploying predictive models to solve real-world problems. With a strong foundation in Python, SQL, Power BI, and various machine learning frameworks, I create solutions that offer meaningful business insights. My portfolio showcases my journey through various data science projects that highlight my ability to handle diverse datasets and develop models that drive decision-making.

## **Skills & Expertise**

**Data Analysis:** Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL, Power BI

**Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Tableau, Power BI

**Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost

**Data Engineering:** SQL, ETL, Web Scraping

**Model Deployment:** Streamlit

**Version Control & Collaboration:** Git, GitHub, Jupyter Notebooks

**Cloud: AWS (S3, EC2), Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**

## **Featured Projects**

#### **1. Customer Churn Prediction**

   
**Goal:** Built a predictive model to identify customers likely to churn, enabling the business to take proactive retention steps.

**Tools:** Python, XGBoost, Scikit-learn, GridSearchCV, Streamlit

##### **Key Highlights:**

- Addressed class imbalance by using the scale_pos_weight parameter in XGBoost, with the ratio:

  scale_pos_weight = len(y_train[y_train == 0]) / len(y_train[y_train == 1])

- Optimized hyperparameters with GridSearchCV, achieving best parameters:

_max_depth:_ 1

_n_estimators:_ 100

- Achieved an overall accuracy score of 80.0% after hyperparameter tuning, with the following performance metrics:

| Label            | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|------------------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| 0 (Not Churn)    | 0.88      | 0.80   | 0.84     | 1036    |
| 1 (Churn)        | 0.55      | 0.69   | 0.62     | 373     |
| **Accuracy**     |           |        | **0.80**     |         |

- Deployed on Streamlit for an interactive user interface to explore model predictions.
