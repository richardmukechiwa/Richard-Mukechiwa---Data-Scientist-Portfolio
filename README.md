### [Medical Charges Prediction](https://github.com/richardmukechiwa/Medical_Charges-Prediction-Random-Forest-Regression.git)

#### Overview

The Medical Charges Prediction project leverages Random Forest Regression to predict medical expenses based on patient demographics and lifestyle factors, such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and region.

#### Objective

This predictive model aids medical insurance companies in estimating patient costs, allowing for better resource allocation and cost management.

#### Key Features

**Data Source:** Kaggle Insurance Dataset

**Model Accuracy:** R-squared of 0.93; captures 93% of variance in medical charges.

**User-Friendly App:** Deployed App where users input demographics to receive cost predictions.

#### Highlights

**Key Variables:** Age, BMI, smoking status, and region are crucial in predicting charges.

**Feature Importance:** Identified smoking habits, age, and BMI as the most influential factors.

### Future Enhancements:  

- Plan to integrate additional lifestyle factors and improve user interface.

**Tools:**  Python, Scikit-learn, Random Forest, Streamlit

### [Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/richardmukechiwa/Customer-Segmentation.git)

### [Sales Uplift Analysis](https://github.com/richardmukechiwa/Sales-Uplift-Analysis-for-Online-Retail-Causal-Impact-Analysis.git)
### [A/B Testing](https://github.com/richardmukechiwa/A-B-Testing-Project.git)

### [Sales Forecasting](https://github.com/richardmukechiwa/Sales-Forecasting-Time-Series)

#### Overview

The Sales Forecasting Project utilizes advanced time series analysis techniques—ARIMA and Prophet—to accurately predict weekly sales based on historical data. By analyzing key variables, we provide valuable insights into sales trends and seasonal patterns, empowering businesses to optimize inventory and enhance decision-making.

#### Key Highlights

**Models Used:** ARIMA and Prophet for robust sales forecasting.

**Data Insights:** Identify trends and seasonal effects to inform strategy.

**Impact:** Improve inventory management and financial planning.
